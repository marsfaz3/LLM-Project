# LLM Project

## Project Task
Selected topic modelling of the 20 Newsgroups dataset to map topics to the information provided.

## Dataset
20 Newsgroups is a dataset with over 18000 observations (split into training/testing data) from newsgroups that can be assigned to 20 topics.

## Pre-trained Model
The pre-trained model selected was a distill-BERT model.

## Performance Metrics
Model performance was okay, with an accuracy of ~25% in topic modelling.

## Hyperparameters
Trial #7 had the best performance using the modified parameters of learning rate, batch size, and epochs.
